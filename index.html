                <h1>The Earth</h1>
            </div>
            The history of Earth concerns the development of planet Earth from its formation to the present day.[1][2]
            Nearly all branches of natural science have contributed to understanding of the main events of Earth's past,
            characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution.

            The geological time scale (GTS), as defined by international convention,[3] depicts the large spans of time
            from the beginning of the Earth to the present, and its divisions chronicle some definitive events of Earth
            history. (In the graphic, Ma means "million years ago".) Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago,
            approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula.[4][5][6] Volcanic
            outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, but the early atmosphere contained
            almost no oxygen. Much of the Earth was molten because of frequent collisions with other bodies which led to
            extreme volcanism. While the Earth was in its earliest stage (Early Earth), a giant impact collision with a
            planet-sized body named Theia is thought to have formed the Moon. Over time, the Earth cooled, causing the
            formation of a solid crust, and allowing liquid water on the surface.

            The Hadean eon represents the time before a reliable (fossil) record of life; it began with the formation of
            the planet and ended 4.0 billion years ago. The following Archean and Proterozoic eons produced the
            beginnings of life on Earth and its earliest evolution. The succeeding eon is the Phanerozoic, divided into
            three eras: the Palaeozoic, an era of arthropods, fishes, and the first life on land; the Mesozoic, which
            spanned the rise, reign, and climactic extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs; and the Cenozoic, which saw
            the rise of mammals. Recognizable humans emerged at most 2 million years ago, a vanishingly small period on
            the geological scale.

            The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago,[7][8][9] during
            the Eoarchean Era, after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon.
            There are microbial mat fossils such as stromatolites found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in
            Western Australia.[10][11][12] Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7
            billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland[13] as well as "remains of
            biotic life" found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[14][15] According to one of the
            researchers, "If life arose relatively quickly on Earth â€¦ then it could be common in the universe."[14]

            Photosynthetic organisms appeared between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago and began enriching the atmosphere
            with oxygen. Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago, when complex
            multicellular life arose, developed over time, and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million
            years ago. This sudden diversification of life forms produced most of the major phyla known today, and
            divided the Proterozoic Eon from the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era. It is estimated that 99 percent
            of all species that ever lived on Earth, over five billion,[16] have gone extinct.[17][18] Estimates on the
            number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,[19] of which about 1.2 million are
            documented, but over 86 percent have not been described.[20] However, it was recently claimed that 1
            trillion species currently live on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described.[21]

            The Earth's crust has constantly changed since its formation, as has life since its first appearance.
            Species continue to evolve, taking on new forms, splitting into daughter species, or going extinct in the
            face of ever-changing physical environments. The process of plate tectonics continues to shape the Earth's
            continents and oceans and the life they harbor

            According to many people, the first computer programmer was the English noblewoman Ada Lovelace. In 1843,
            she published a sequence of steps to perform using a computing machine designed by her friend, Charles
            Babbage. These notes are considered the first computer program.

            In 1840, Charles Babbage gave a lecture about his computing machine in Italy. An Italian mathematician wrote
            a transcript of the lecture and published it. Ada Lovelace translated the article to English, and spent nine
            months writing additional notes about it. The notes were three times longer than the article. One section of
            the notes included a method to use Charles Babbage's machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, a mathematical
            sequence. As a mathematician, they were a subject of interest to Ada. This method was an algorithm designed
            to be carried out by a machine, which is the simplest description of a computer program.

            The program that Ada Lovelace wrote was for Charles Babbage's "Analytical Engine", a mechanical
            general-purpose computer he designed, but never completed. The design included memory, an arithmetic logic
            unit (processor), and control flow for looping. This means it would have had all of the key elements of a
            modern computer.

            Ada Lovelace was the child of the English poet George Lord Byron, though he left the country less than a
            year after she was born, and never returned. Her mother, Anne Milbanke, supported Ada's love of mathematics
            and science.

            Ada was born in 1815 as "The Honourable Augusta Ada Byron", and married William, 8th Baron King in 1835.
            William was made the Earl of Lovelace in 1838, making her the Countess of Lovelace. They had three children.

            The first electronic computers were not built until the 1940s, but the early work of Ada Lovelace was an
            important moment in the history of computers.
