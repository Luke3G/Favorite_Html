    <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises
        vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell,
        DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and
        Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music
        spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop,[1] while they later transitioned into more electronica — and
        pop-influenced music.[2]
        <br>
        Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album,<a
            href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UnWZMsTwHA target="blank"> Hybrid Theory</a> (2000),
        which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] Released during the
        peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer",
        "Crawling" and "In the End" all to chart highly on the Mainstream Rock chart; the latter crossed over to the pop
        chart.[4] Their second album,<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV_76Nc1Ue8 target="blank"> Meteora</a>
        (2003), continued the band's success.[5] The band explored experimental
        sounds on their third album, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBKrpLzlfa8 target="blank"> Minutes to
            Midnight</a> (2007).[6] By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the
        most successful and popular rock acts.[7]
        <br>
        The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album,<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C_Wrt6pNSw" target="blank"> A Thousand Suns</a> (2010),
        layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrbaN38cYhw" target=blank"> Living Things</a> (2012), combined musical
        elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IhOL8GyXyA" target="blank"> The Hunting Party</a> (2014), returned to
        a
        heavier
        rock sound, and their seventh album, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo90nWXy0KQ target=" blank"> One
            More Light</a> (2017), was their first pop-oriented record.[8] Linkin Park
        went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died by suicide in July 2017

    <p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; formerly stylized
        as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Eminem is among the best-selling music
        artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He is credited with
        popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all
        time.[2]
        <br>

        Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the
        acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the early 2000s made
        him hugely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass. He has
        been influential for many artists of various genres. After his debut album <a
